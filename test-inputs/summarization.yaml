    inputText: "Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn from data without being explicitly programmed. It uses algorithms to identify patterns in data and make predictions or decisions. Common applications include image recognition, natural language processing, and recommendation systems. The field has grown rapidly due to increased computing power and availability of large datasets."

    inputText: "I've been using this laptop for three months now, and I'm really impressed. The battery life is excellent - I can get through a full workday without charging. The keyboard is comfortable for long typing sessions, and the screen is bright and sharp. My only complaint is that it can get a bit warm when running intensive applications, but overall it's a great device for the price."

    inputText: "This study investigated the effects of sleep deprivation on cognitive performance in adults aged 25-40. Participants were divided into three groups: normal sleep (7-9 hours), moderate restriction (5-6 hours), and severe restriction (3-4 hours). Results showed significant decline in attention, working memory, and decision-making abilities in the restricted sleep groups. The effects were dose-dependent, with greater impairment in the severe restriction group. Recovery to baseline performance required 2-3 nights of normal sleep duration."
